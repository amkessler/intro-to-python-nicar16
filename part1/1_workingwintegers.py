#INTEGERS

#In programming, an integer is a whole number. You can do all sorts of math on integers,
#just like you'd do with a calculator or in Excel or a database manager.

2+2

5*5

# Order of operations also works the same as real-world math you learned back in grade school

2+2*10

# ...is different than 

(2+2)*10

# we can create a variable for a number - which is a name that stands in for the actual integer

mynumber = 14

#Once you have a variable, you can run math on it by using its name like you would the number

# Multiplication
mynumber * 5

# Division
mynumber / 2

# Addition
mynumber + 20

# Subtraction
mynumber - 5

# You can get as complex as you want with these...
(mynumber*2+56)/100


#you can idenifty what TYPE your variable is like this 
type(mynumber)

# Import modules


# Write a function to do some exploring with numbers


    # Open the csv
    

    # Create the object that represents the data in the csv file
    

    # Create a variable to represent the header row
    

    # Let's get the first row of data
  

    # Let's create a variable off the bat to isolate the number that is the gross sales
    

    # Let's output the value
    

    # Let's get the length of the number
    

    # For kicks, let's multiply gross sales by 2.
    # We should get 36567671.24, assuming the gross sales we're using is 18283835.62.
    # Because it's not an number, when we try to double it, python will simply repeat the string.
    

    # Let's double-check its type
    

    # Let's convert the string to a number 
    



    # Now let's try some math...

    # Multiplication
    

    # Division
    

    # Addition
    

    # Subtraction
    

    # Order of operations
    

    # Close the csv file when we're done
    

# Call the function, passing as an argument the name of the csv file to open.

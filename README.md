		- We'll extract the zipped files into our "virtual environment" folder
	- Every step/module we'll go through has two companion files: 
		- One has only comments and no Python code, that's what we'll usingn to write our code together
		- One has all the Python code already filled in. This is for your reference if you get lost
		  during the class, and you're welcome to refer to it. It's also helpful for taking home.
